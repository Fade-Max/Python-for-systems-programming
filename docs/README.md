The Python programming language is increasingly popular.  It is a
versatile language for general purpose programming and accessible
for novice programmers.  For more than a decade, Python has been
used for a large number of systems-related programming tasks.
This training introduces modules that are useful in that context.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * know how to write scripts that handle command line arguments,
    configuration files and environment variables;
  * know how to log information or errors from your applications;
  * be able to perform file system-related tasks;
  * be able to use a templating library for reporting;
  * be able to interact with processes on a Linux system;
  * be able to interact with remote systems using SSH;
  * be able to interact with compressed files.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Python-for-systems-programming),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use Python for scripting and
coordination of processes.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.

If you plan to do Python programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
